# 2048 Game
This repository contains the code for a command-line version of the popular game 2048, implemented in Python. 
It consists of three main files: `cell.py`, `game.py`, and `gui.py`. These files define the logic and functionality of the game.

## Files
- `cell.py`: This file contains the `Cell` class, which represents a single cell in the game grid. 
             It defines the properties and methods of a cell, such as its value and color.

- `game.py`: This file contains the `Game` class, which represents the overall game.
             It implements the game logic, including the moves (up, down, left, right), random cell generation, 
             scoring, and checking for game over or win conditions.

- `gui.py`: This file contains the graphical user interface (GUI) implementation of the game using the Tkinter library.
            It provides a visual representation of the game board and allows the player to interact with the game using keyboard inputs.

## How to Play
To play the game, simply run the `gui.py` file using Python. 
The game board will be displayed in a window, and you can use the arrow keys to move the tiles in different directions.
The goal is to combine tiles with the same number to reach the target value of 2048.

## Requirements
The game requires Python 3 and the Tkinter library to be installed.
